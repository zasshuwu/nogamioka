## Deployment

### PaaS/SaaS

I recommend using Vercel but if you're averse to vendor lock-in, Github Pages should be fine.

Note: I currently am not maintaining a Dockerfile for this project version, but will probably in the future.

### Bare-metal/IaaS

> Assuming you are deploying on a Linux-based server

- Install pre-requisites, clone, install dependencies
- Build: `yarn build`
- Serve: `yarn start`
- Install `nginx` for reverse proxy, run with `systemctl enable --now nginx` on systemd distros.
- Install `ufw` for firewall management, run with `sudo ufw enable`, configure to allow port 80 and 443 `sudo ufw allow http && sudo ufw allow https`.
- Configure `nginx` to route your ports 80 and 443 to internal port `3000`, which is the default port that `Nextjs` serves.
